# SCS-100

## PubSub Mechanism

A simple Example of an Event Driven Flow by the help of **SPRING CLOUD STREAM KAFKA**

##### properties

* java.version: `11`
* spring-cloud.version: `Hoxton.SR12` (To get Advantage of Binders `@Input`,`@Output`)
* spring-boot.version: `2.4.13`

### Documentation
Please visit [Spring Cloud Stream Kafka (Part 2)](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/event-streaming/spring-cloud-stream-kafka-p2/) for Project documentation


![General Flow Diagram](material/kafka-events-intro-100.svg)

The Docker-compose file contains: single kafka and zookeeper. just simply run the following command

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

or 
- Control Center UI
Runs a [Confluent Control Center](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/index.html) that exposes a UI at `http://localhost:9021/` .

```shell
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml up
```
To stop the brokers and the Control Center UI run the following command:
```shell
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml down
```

> I assume you already have docker setup in your machine.

### Make the project

run the following command line to create you jar file in `target` directory

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then run the generated jar file in `target` folder, (so make sure you are in the same directory when you run the jar file
or give the full path)

```shell
java -jar scs-100-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

the application starts to listen on port 8080. make sure that port not being occupied by any other app already, if is try
to pass the following parameter before `-jar` by adding `-Dserver.port=8081` as:

```shell
java --server.port=8081 -jar target/scs-100-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
or

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8081
```


> you can also modify the application.yml and set the same properties based on your app profile

At this point you should have already seen the information about your topics.

### Check Application

#### Create Order or Place your Order
you should now be able to place your order by calling the following `curl` command

```shell
# assuming your app is listening on 8080
ORDER_UUID=$(curl --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"itemName\":\"book\"}" http://localhost:8080/order | jq -r '.orderUuid') && for i in `seq 1 15`; do echo $(curl --silent "http://localhost:8080/order/status/"$ORDER_UUID); sleep 1; done;
```
> make sure you have already installed the `jq`

> **âš  NOTE:**   Starting with ``spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka 3.0``, when ``spring.cloud.stream.binding.<name>.consumer.batch-mode`` is set to ``true``, all of the records received by polling the Kafka Consumer will be presented as a List<?> to the listener method. Otherwise, the method will be called with one record at a time. The size of the batch is controlled by Kafka consumer properties max.poll.records, fetch.min.bytes, fetch.max.wait.ms; refer to the Kafka documentation for more information.
> 
> Bear in mind that ``batch mode is not supported with @StreamListener`` - it only works with the newer ``functional programming model``.
