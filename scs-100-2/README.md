# SCS-100-2

## Functional Programming (For Alternative of SCS-100 Project)

A simple Example of an Event Driven Flow by the help of **SPRING CLOUD STREAM KAFKA**

##### properties

* java.version: `11`

The Docker-compose file contains: single kafka and zookeeper. just simply run the following command

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

> I assume you already have docker setup in your machine.

### Make the project

run the following command line to create you jar file in `target` directory

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then run the generated jar file in `target` folder, (so make sure you are in the same directory when you run the jar
file or give the full path)

```shell
java -jar scs-100-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

the application starts to listen on port 8080.

**To scale** the application horizontally you can add the following parameter before `-jar` by
adding `-Dserver.port=8081` (basically a different port) as:

```shell
java -Dserver.port=8081 -jar scs-100-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

> When you running multiple instances of the same application on a single machine, this path must be unique for each
such instance.
At this point you should have already seen the information about your topics
, [to read more](https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#state-dir)

### Check Application

#### Create Order or Place your Order

you should now be able to place your order by calling the following `curl` command

```shell
# assuming your app is listening on 8080
ORDER_UUID=$(curl --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"itemName\":\"book\"}" http://localhost:8080/order | jq -r '.orderUuid') && for i in `seq 1 15`; do sleep 1; echo $(curl --silent "http://localhost:8080/order/status/"$ORDER_UUID); done;
```

Note: make sure you have already installed the `jq`

## Running Multi Instances

Now let’s run the same application multiple times at the same time to simulate the application redundancy. But before
that make sure that the current application is not running.

This project code comes with Nginx as LoadBalancer which has already been configured to distribute the incoming traffic
from port 8080 and route it into 8081 and 8082.

So first let’s start it in different docker-compose from root on this project “scs-100-2” as:

```shell
docker-compose -f nginx/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Since the port 8080 is already got occupied by nginx we can run the Ordering application as follow in 2 separated
terminal

_Terminal 1:_

```shell
java -Dserver.port=8081 -jar target/scs-100-2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

_And on Terminal 2:_

```shell
java -Dserver.port=8082 -jar target/scs-100-2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

_Then run our curl call command again (same as the earlier one)_

```shell
ORDER_UUID=$(curl --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"itemName\":\"book\"}" http://localhost:8080/order | jq -r '.orderUuid') && for i in `seq 1 15`; do sleep 1; echo $(curl --silent "http://localhost:8080/order/status/"$ORDER_UUID); done;
```
